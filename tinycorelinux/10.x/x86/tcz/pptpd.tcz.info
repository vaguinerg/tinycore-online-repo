Comments:       Compiled with --enable-bcrelay
                Compiled without encryption (make sure your VPN client is set to
                not use encryption as well)
                To Start
                ----------
                1) Make sure the correct localip and bcrelay interface are
                   specified in /etc/pptpd.conf. The startup script attempts to
                   do this but usually gets it wrong.
                2) Make sure /etc/ppp/chap-secrets is configured properly
                3) Run pptpd as root
