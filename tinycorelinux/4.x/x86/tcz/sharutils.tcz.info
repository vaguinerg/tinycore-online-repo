Comments:       GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files,
		preparing them for transmission by electronic mail services.
		A shell archive is a collection of files that can be unpacked
		by /bin/sh. A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility
		in manufacturing shars and in specifying shar smartness.
		For example, shar may compress files, uuencode binary files,
		split long files and construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct
		unsharing order, and provide simplistic checksums.

		This extension is PPI compatible.
