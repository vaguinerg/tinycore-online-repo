Comments:	----------------------------------------------
		Surf is a really minimalistic webbrowser with only gtk2 and webkit as dependencies!
		
		Use it like this:
		surf www.tinycorelinux.com

		Or press Ctrl-g inside surf to open the URL-bar.
		
		Surf doesn't have tabs, but you can make up for this using a tiling window manager.
		
		Full instructions in included man page or here:

		This extension is PPI compatible.
