Tags:	    Graphical cdrecord frontend.
Comments:       Requires cdrtools.tcz and gtk1.tcz and it's dependencies.
                Non-root mode is already setup, but you must run once as root
		and save a setup to use as an unprivileged user.
		Backup the file /usr/local/etc/xcdroast.conf for the 
		settings to persist across reboots and not have to run
		the setup as root every following reboot.
		This extension is PPI compatible and does not 
		conflict with the gtk2 version, they can both be installed
		at the same time.
