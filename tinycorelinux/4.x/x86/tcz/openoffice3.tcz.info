Tags:		This Go-oo Tiny Core variant original OpenOffice.org.
Comments:	Go-oo (previously called ooo-build) is a concentrated set of patches
		for the cross-platform OpenOffice.org office suite. Go-oo is also one
		of OpenOffice.org variants created from these patches. It has better
		support for Office Open XML file formats than the official OpenOffice.org
		releases produced by Sun Microsystems and other enhancements that have
		either not yet been accepted into the upstream Sun version, or will not
		be because of business or political reasons. Some of these changes or
		enhancements will eventually be part of the Sun version too, given time.
		
		Optional extensions:
			ALSA or OSS, gst-plugins-*,gst-ffmpeg, liberation-fonts-ttf,
			sil-gentium-ttf, sil-gentium-basic-ttf, msttcorefonts (available at forums/scripting),
			openclipart-svg, cups, hunspell-en-us (or any other hunspell dictionary) ...

		OpenOffice.org extensions are also recommended.(dictionaries,templates etc.)

		You can install OpenOffice.org extensions from http://extensions.services.openoffice.org
		Download any extension and Tools->Extension Manager->Add and select the extension (.oxt) file to install

		Note: OpenOffice3 installs your extensions into ~/.openoffice.org
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
