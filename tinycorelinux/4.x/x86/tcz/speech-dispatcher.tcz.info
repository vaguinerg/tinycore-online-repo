Comments:       
    This extension is PPI compatible.
	Built and tested on TC2.0rc2.1
	Allows, for example, yasr to use (for example) espeak for Text to 
	Speech output.
	
	To use with yasr and espeak (if both are also installed), open a 
	console (or at the commandline)	and enter:
	    sudo speech-dispatcher
		yasr
	Anything appearing on the console should now be read by espeak.
	(Press alt-x to temporarily silence yasr).
	Note: To kill the speech system (one method anyway...):
	first kill yasr by closing the console from which yasr was activated
	and then in another console enter: sudo killall speech-dispatcher
	(Other methods often leave behind zombie processes).
