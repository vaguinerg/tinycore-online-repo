Comments:       Console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a log 
                of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It 
                uses the network interface statistics provided by the 
                kernel as information source. This means that vnStat 
                won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures 
                light use of system resources.

                Create databases for your interfaces:
                 sudo vnstat -u -i eth0 --force --config /usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf
                 sudo vnstat -u -i eth1 --force --config /usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf
                 sudo vnstat -u -i ppp0 --force --config /usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf
                 etc...

                Start vnstat daemon to update the database regulary:
                 sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/vnstat start

                Once the database built for your(s) device(s), call vnstat as user.
                 example for hourly output: vnstat -h
                 example for daily output: vnstat -d
                 example for weekly output: vnstat -w

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
                
                This extension is PPI Compatible.
                Just add usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf; var/lib/vnstat into your /opt/.filetool.lst

                There are several web frontends avaliable for vnstat.

                Restrictions:
                  Updates needs to be executed at least as often as it is possible
                 for the interface to generate enough traffic to wrap the kernel
                 interface traffic counter. Otherwise it is possible that some traffic
                 won't be seen. This isn't an issue for 64 bit kernels but at least one
                 update every hour is always required in order to provide proper input.
                 With 32 bit kernels the maximum time between two updates depends on how
                 fast the interface can transfer 4 GiB. Calculated theoretical times are:
                  10 Mbit: 54 minutes
                  100 Mbit: 5 minutes
                  1000 Mbit: 30 seconds
                 Estimated traffic values are likely to be somewhat inaccurate if daily
                 traffic is low because only the MiB counter is used to calculate the estimate.
