Comments: This is the home page for normalize, an audio file volume normalizer.
		   normalize is a tool for adjusting the volume of audio files to a
		   standard level. This is useful for things like creating mixed CD's
		   and mp3 collections, where different recording levels on different
		   albums can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.
