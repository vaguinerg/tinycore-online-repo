Comments:       
    This extension is PPI compatible.
	Built and tested on TC2.0rc2.1
	Yasr can use espeak for Text to Speech output via speech-dispatcher.
	To use with speech-dispatcher and espeak (if both are also 
	installed), open a console (or at the commandline) enter:
	    sudo speech-dispatcher
		yasr
	Anything appearing on the console should now be read by espeak.
	(Press alt-x to temporarily silence yasr).
	Note: To kill the speech system (one method anyway...):
	first kill yasr by closing the console from which yasr was activated
	and then in another console enter: sudo killall speech-dispatcher
	(Other methods often leave behind zombie processes).
	You can control what/how sentences are read (chars, words etc):		  
	  Press ctrl alt o to select yasr options,
      And press key s until you hear "synthesiser option"
      Tap the right cursor key once to hear the word "rate"
      space bar (or a further tap on the right cursor key) lets you 
	  then alter that rate (i.e. the speed of e speak speaking). If 
	  you change you mind about entering a new value, press escape key 
	  to abort, and then continue selecting options if you wish by 
	  pressing s (or the up/down cursor key).
      Alternatively, one you first hear the word "rate", continually 
	  tapping down cursor key will take you through all of the 
	  synthesiser options:
      rate, pitch, volume, language, output module (for cases where you
	  have an alternative speech synthesiser to e speak), punctuation 
	  (whatever punctuation you want spoken)
      Then press escape key to leave the options and ctrl alt s to 
	  save as before. 
	  Read uploaded to TC forum: yasr_usageNotes.txt for key-bindings
	  used with yasr to read, for example, previous line, next line,
	  next word, whole screen, silence yasr and so on.
