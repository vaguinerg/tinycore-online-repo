Comments:	If you want to use the included pcf2vpnc script you will
		have to install the perl5.tcz extension once as it is not
		included in the dependencies (due to size).
		
		Then do:
		  1. pcf2vpnc your.pcf > your.conf
		  2. sudo cp your.conf /usr/local/etc/vpnc/
		  3. sudo vpnc your
	
		Add your.conf to your backup and for automatic start put in
		your username and password as well.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible
Change-log:	10/02/03 Fix /etc/vpnc to /usr/local/etc/vpnc.
		10/02/02 Bump to svn 0.5.3-svn449, rebuild, reduce size.
		09/08/29 Initial version.
Current:	10/02/03
