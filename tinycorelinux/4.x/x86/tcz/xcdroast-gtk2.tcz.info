Tags:	    Graphical cdrecord frontend.
Comments:       Requires cdrtools.tcz and gtk2.tcz and it's dependencies.
                Non-root mode is already setup, but you must run once as root
		and save a setup to use as an unprivileged user.
		Backup the file /usr/local/etc/xcdroast.conf for the
		settings to persist across reboots and not to have to run
		the setup as root after every following reboot.
		This extension is PPI compatible and does not 
		conflict with the gtk1 version, they can both be installed
		at the same time.
