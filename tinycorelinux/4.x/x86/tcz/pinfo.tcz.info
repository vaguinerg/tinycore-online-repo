Comments:       Pinfo is a hypertext info file viewer with a user interface
                similar to lynx. It is based on curses/ncurses, and can handle
                info pages as well as man pages. It also features regexp
                searching and user-defined colors/keys.

                To inverse-quote the author of htop, pinfo is for info what
                htop is for top :)

                Binaries only.

                This extension is PPI compatible.
