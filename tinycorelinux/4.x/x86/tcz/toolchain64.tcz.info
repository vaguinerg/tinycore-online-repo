Comments:       If you need something compiled 64-bit, this is the way.
		Either run toolchain64-shell, or start it from the menu;
		this sets up some variables so that you can build easier.
-
		Example:
		./configure --host=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
-
		Note that this is a cross-compiler, and so there might 
		be some more difficulties compared to native compiling.

		This extension contains:
		- 2.6.32.7 kernel headers (GPL)
		- glibc 2.7 + patches (GPL)
