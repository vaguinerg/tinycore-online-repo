Tags:		RXVT-Unicode Terminal Emulator Daemonized version
Comments:	A clone of the RXVT terminal emulator that supports 
		Unicode. This version supports daemonized instances, so 
		that you can run multiple terminals and use less memory. 
		The urxvtd program (the daemon) needs to be running 
		first; urxvtc (the client) requests a new terminal 
		window from it.
		
		To automate the process, place in your .xsession or 
		.xinitrc file the following:
		
		urxvtd -q -o -f
		
		Then call urxvtc whenever you want a new terminal.

		This version supports 256 colors and has disabled 
		support for the AfterImage library, as well as the 
		built-in perl interpreter.
