Comments:       To use StarDict, you must first install a dictionary. 
                The squashfs-tools extension is needed for the following
                     procedure and is included as a dependency.
                1. Go to http://stardict.sourceforge.net/Dictionaries.php
                2. Download a tarball.
                3. Type: dict2ext dictionary.tar.bz2
                   This creates the extension dictionary.tcz.
                4. Move it to your tce folder and reboot. 
                   Or type: tce-load -i dictionary.tcz
