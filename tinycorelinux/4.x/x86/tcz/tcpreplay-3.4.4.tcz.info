Comments:	Tcprelay is a suite of GPLv3 licensed tools which gives you
		the ability to use previously captured traffice in libpcap
		format to test a variety of network devices. It allows you to
		classify traffic as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 and
		4 headers, and finally replay the traffice onto the network
		and through other devices such as swiches, routers, firewalls,
		NIDS, and IPS's. Tcpreplay supports both single and dual NIC
		modes for testing both sniffing and inline devices.
