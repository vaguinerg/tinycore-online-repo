Comments:       After decades of war one company, who had gained powerful supplying 
		both sides with weaponary, steps forwards and crushes both warring factions 
		in one swift movement. Using far superior weaponary and AI craft, the company 
		was completely unstoppable and now no one can stand in their way. Thousands 
		began to perish under the iron fist of the company. The people cried out for 
		a saviour, for someone to light this dark hour... and someone did.
		
		Xorg is recommended.

		You need OSS or ALSA for sound.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
