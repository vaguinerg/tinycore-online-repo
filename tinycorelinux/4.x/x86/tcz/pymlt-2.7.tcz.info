Comments:       MLT is an open source multimedia framework, designed 
                and developed for television broadcasting. It provides 
                a toolkit for broadcasters, video editors, media players, 
                transcoders, web streamers and many more types of 
                applications. The functionality of the system is provided 
                via an assortment of ready to use tools, XML authoring 
                components, and an extensible plug-in based API.

                This extension is PPI compatible.
