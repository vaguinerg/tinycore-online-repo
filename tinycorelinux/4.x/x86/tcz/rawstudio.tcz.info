Tags:	    An application process raw photos digital cameras.
Comments:       A raw photo processor with a very intuitive interface.
		If your camera is not supported, I would suggest using dcraw to output a 16-bit TIFF.
		This TIFF can then be edited using Rawstudio.
		For a nicer user interface, install "gtk-engines.tcz".
		This extension is PPI compatible.
