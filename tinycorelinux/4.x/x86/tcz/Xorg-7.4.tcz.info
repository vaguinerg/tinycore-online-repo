Comments:       Starting TC 2.3, you don't need to do anything beyond 
		restarting X after loading the extension, to run 
		confless. If you need to configure something, such as 
		keymap, or have hardware trouble with autodetection, 
		create a xorg.conf:

		If you are only looking to get software 3D
		and no accel, instead of creating a config file
		suitable for your hardware like below, you can rename
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf.vesa to xorg.conf.
.
		To get Xorg with accel, drop to text mode,
		get a root console (sudo su), and then
		Xorg -configure
.
		Edit the newly created config file as needed,
		when it's ready copy it to /etc/X11 named xorg.conf
		Remember to add this file to your backup (/opt/.filetool.lst)
		or save it some other way.
.
		This extension depends on graphics-KERNEL.tcz for
		any kind of 3D or video accel.
.
		Please note, for AGP or integrated AGP cards such as Intel 
		chips you will always need graphics-KERNEL.tcz.
.
		Tips on 3D and X keymaps can be found
		in /etc/X11/README.xorg.conf.
.
		If you don't use a persistent local or TCZ, be wary
		unless you have atleast 256mb ram!
.
		Only in versions before 2.3:
		Edit .xsession by replacing the X line with
		/usr/local/bin/Xorg -nolisten tcp &
.
		To enable Ctrl-Alt-Bksp to terminate Xorg add the following
		to your xorg.conf
.
		Section "ServerFlags"
        	Option          "DontZap" "false"
		EndSection
.
