Comments:	set_rlimits is a small wrapper program to allow people to take advantage of
		the realtime resource limit extensions available in Linux kernels 2.6.12 and
		later without having to resort to using a PAM module.  This is of particular
		interest for Slackware users since Slackware doesn't use PAM, but other
		users may find this program helpful as well.  In addition, several other
		resource limits can be manipulated by the program.
		
		set_rlimits needs to be installed setuid root.  However, it runs at
		elevated priviledges only when setting the process resource limits.  This
		minimises potential security implications.  Despite this, no security 
		guarantee is given; users concerned about the security of this program
		should review the source code themselves.  Suggestions on improving security
		are welcomed by the author.
		
		The resource limits which set_rlimits is permitted to grant are controlled
		in /usr/local/etc/set_rlimits.conf (change in source: set_rlimits.c). 
		This file sets the maximum priorities which
		set_rlimits can set for a given program when executed by a given user or
		group.  The program specified must include an absolute path.  This gives an
		administrator fairly fine-grained control over who can execute programs at
		elevated priorities and which programs they are.  The enforced specification
		of an absolute path in the configuration file means the administrator can
		maintain control over exactly which programs may be run with elevated
		resource limits.
		
		For further details on the configuration file format, refer to the
		/usr/local/etc/set_rlimits.conf.example provided in the extension, or the
		source itself.
