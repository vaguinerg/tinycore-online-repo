Comments:       This version is based on the binary distribution for x86:
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbcl/files/sbcl/1.0.48/sbcl-1.0.48-x86-linux-binary.tar.bz2

		For some reason doesn't seem to work properly. You can try:
                $ sbcl
                * (require 'asdf)
                * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :asdf-install)
                * (asdf-install:install 'clx)

		This extension is PPI compatible.
