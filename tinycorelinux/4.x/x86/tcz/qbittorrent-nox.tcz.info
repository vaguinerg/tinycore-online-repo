Tags:		Free Software alternative µtorrent. This WebUI-only version.
Comments:	The WebUI has fewer configuration options than the GUI version.

		If you want to make use of any function not configurable through the WebUI,
		you can either install the GUI version alongside this one and setup everything through it,
		or you can edit the config file manually at: ~/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf

		Example: If you want to keep seeding torrents to a ratio of 1.4 and then pause them, add the following to the config file:
		Bittorrent\MaxRatio=1.4
		Bittorrent\MaxRatioAction=0

		Magnet:
		You can add magnet links through the "Download from URL" option in the WebUI.

		Multi-user:
		If you want each user to have their own private torrent downloads, you can run a separate instance of qbittorrent-nox for each of them.
		The easiest way to do this, that I know of, is:
		su -c "qbittorrent-nox [--webui-port=x]" [USERNAME] & ## You may need to run this as root.
