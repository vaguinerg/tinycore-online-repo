Comments:       Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are
                able to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface and
                simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour
                of the circuit. After that simulation has finished you can 
                view the results on a presentation page or window.
