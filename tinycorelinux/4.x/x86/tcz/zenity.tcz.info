Comments:	Zenity is a tool that allows you to display Gtk+ dialog boxes from the 
		command line and through shell scripts. It is similar to gdialog, but is 
		intended to be saner. It comes from the same family as dialog, 
		Xdialog, and cdialog, but it surpasses those projects by having a cooler name.
				
		This extension is PPI compatible.
