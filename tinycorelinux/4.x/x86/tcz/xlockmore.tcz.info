Comments:       Xlockmore requires no other extensions to run.  If
		you have not already set a passwork, you will be
		prompted to set one before your screen locks.  A word
		of warning: this extension disables the control key 
		when Xlockmore is in operation, so be sure to 
		remember your passwd as Ctrl-Alt-Backspace or
		Ctrl-Alt-Delete will not exit X or reboot the machine
		until you enter a passwd and return to your desktop.
