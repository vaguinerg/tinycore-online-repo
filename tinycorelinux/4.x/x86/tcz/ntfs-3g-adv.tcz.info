Comments:       Ntfs-3g is considered a stable read/write driver for
                NTFS formatted volumes.  This extension has been tested
                but use ntfs-3g at your own risk on production machines.
                
                The advanced releases are designed as add-ons to the latest
                stable release, so they benefit from all the improvements 
                and fixes integrated in the main branch. This facilitates 
                the subsequent integration of the newer features both for 
                the developer and the user.
                
                *** This extension conflicts with the regular extension   ***
