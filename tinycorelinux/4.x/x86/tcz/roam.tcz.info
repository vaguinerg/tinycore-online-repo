Comments:	If you own a laptop with wifi and ethernet this is for you.
		I wrote this as a lightweight and resource saving alternative to 
		wicd and network-manager.
		It switches between ethernet and wireless depending on whether
		there is a cable inserted and then uses DHCP to get an IP.

		Setup:
		- adjust your network interface names in /usr/local/etc/roam.conf
		- initialise roaming by typing: sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/roam
		- setup your wireless networks with wpa_gui.tcz (will save 
		  to wpa_supplicant.conf automatically)

		Persistence:
		- backup roam.conf and wpa_supplicant.conf
		- add /usr/local/etc/init.d/roam to /opt/bootlocal.sh
		
		You can look at the scripts and edit ifup and ifdown to include
		your own modifications, e.g. if you need a static IP or have to
		use a vpn. Also please send me your patches if you think others
		may have a need for them.
		
		wpa_supplicant and thus wpa_gui also support wep and plaintext!
		
		wpa_gui depends on qt, sorry about that. As you won't need to
		run it very often you should install it ondemand.
