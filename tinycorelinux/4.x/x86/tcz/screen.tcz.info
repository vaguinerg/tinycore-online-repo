Comments:       " Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a 
                physical terminal between several processes, typically 
                interactive shells. " -- From GNU Screen website

                Basically, screen allows you to create virtual terminals 
                You can disconnect from a screen session and reconnect from
                somewhere else while preserving your shell and other running
                processes (mail/irc/bit torent/long builds, etc).

                You can also have more than one connection to a session,
                or allow other users to connect to your same session.

                It's also handy for working over a shaky connection - your
                apps stay running if your session gets interupted.

                And this is only the tip of the iceberg!
