Comments:       Console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a log 
                of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It 
                uses the network interface statistics provided by the 
                kernel as information source. This means that vnStat 
                won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures 
                light use of system resources.

                This package contains the man pages.
