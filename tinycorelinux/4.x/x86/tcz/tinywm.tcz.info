		From the website:
		1.	Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 
			drag (left mouse button)
		2.	Resize windows interactively with 
			Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)
		3.	Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on 
			usability I know, but I needed a keybinding 
			in there somewhere)
		4.	Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X 
			does this on its own)
