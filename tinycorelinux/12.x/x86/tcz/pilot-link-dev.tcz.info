Comments:       Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
                with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
                and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
                used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools.
                This version includes significant changes to support
                libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core. Tested on TC 3.1 with a
                Palm Tungsten E.
                This is the development extension. It includes headers,
                binaries* other than pilot-xfer, and support files for
                dlpsh and the pilot-link debugger.
