Comments:	GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for
                Zile Is Lossy Emacs. Zile has been written to be as
                similar as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel
                at home.
                Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features:
                - It is 8-bit clean (though it currently lacks Unicode
                  support).
                - The number of editing buffers and windows is only
                  limited by available memory and screen space respectively.
                - Registers, minibuffer completion and auto fill are
                  available.
                - Function and variable names are identical with Emacs's.
                However, all of this is packed into a program which
                typically compiles to about 130Kb.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
