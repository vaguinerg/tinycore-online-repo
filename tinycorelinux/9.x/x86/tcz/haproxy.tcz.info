                HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, 
                load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. 

                It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while 
                needing persistence or Layer7 processing. Supporting tens of thousands of 
                connections is clearly realistic with todays hardware. Its mode of operation 
                makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while 
                still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net.
