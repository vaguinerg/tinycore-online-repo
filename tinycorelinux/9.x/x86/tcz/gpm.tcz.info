                See config file /usr/local/etc/gpm/gpm.conf to
                set approprite settings.  Default settings work with
                ps2, usb, and my own touch screen keyboard mouse, but
                if for some reason that is not sufficient enter
                appropriate values.  Start gpm with /usr/local/etc/init.d/gpm,
                which will read the above mentioned config file for
                settings.
