Comments:       lm_sensors can show various sensor output from some motherboards or cards.
		Not all have sensors builtin. The following assumes you want results on reboot
		
                First run $ sudo sensors-detect, to identify available sensors, then
                check /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors for necessary kernel modules. 
		eg last lines in that file could be	
		MODULE_0=coretemp
		MODULE_1=it87

		Add lines to /opt/bootlocal.sh in reverse order to your list eg
		/sbin/modprobe it87
		/sbin/modprobe coretemp

		Add "etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors" without the quotes to /opt/.filetool.lst 
		Add "lm_sensors.tcz" without the quotes to your tce/onboot.lst if not there

		Reboot and run $ sensors

    		Some sensors may output incorrect values so read  /etc/sensors3.conf.
		If changes made, add your config file to your /opt/.filetool.lst please

		Supported chips http://www.lm-sensors.org/browser/lm-sensors/trunk/doc/chips/SUMMARY

		Want simple output? Install inxi and run
		$ inxi -s (or) more output $ inxi -v 5 -- see inxi -h for other options
		Want continuous output?
		Install conky but I am not an expert on it tho.

		Note this does not need sensord (daemon) running. Each time you check sensors,
		you will get a different value. YMMV
