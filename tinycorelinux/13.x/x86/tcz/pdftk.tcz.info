		altering PDF files. Call pdftk --help or see the web site for
		details.
		Building: a time consuming process. Build gcc to enable gcj
		support, download/install ecj-$VER.jar into your path, edit the
		pdftk Makefile.Debian makefile (follow its instructions), and
		make.
		This extension includes the libgcj library and the pdftk
		binary. There are no external docs or development items.
		The first version was built on TC 3.3 with gcj 4.5.1 and
		ecj 4.5.
