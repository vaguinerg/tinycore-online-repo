Tags:	    GTK2 archive manager that supports many formats.
Comments:       Some formats (tar, unrar, p7zip, gzip) require the full GNU programs.
                They are listed as dependencies, but you can pick the ones you want.
                Some others (rpm2cpio) are included in the package.
                To handle additional formats (lzma, arj), just install their programs.
		When extracting, make sure to distinguish between All Files and Selected Files.
		Optional: xz.tcz, bzip2.tcz, p7zip-full.tcz, arj.tcz
