Tags:	    libdvdread provides functionality that required access many DVDs.
Comments:       libdvdread currently uses libdl to dynamically probe for libdvdcss
		at runtime. If found, libdvdcss will be used to decrypt sections of
		the DVD as necessary.
		libdvdcss.tcz is recommended.
		This extension conflicts with libdvdread.tcz (libdvdread3)
		This extension is PPI compatible.
