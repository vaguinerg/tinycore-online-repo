Comments:	Tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series Intel
		graphics chipsets. This includes the 830, 845G, 855G, and 865G
		chipsets, as well as 915G, 915GM, 945G, 946GZ, G965, and Q965
		chipsets. This modification may be necessary to display certain
		graphics resolutions with an X server, and especially with the
		default XVesa that ships with Tiny Core Linux.
		Note that modifications to the video BIOS are transient, not
		permanent. So, you need to set the configuration every time you
		start the machine (and before you start up the X server).
		Obvious place to invoke 915resolution in Tiny Core Linux is
		thus from /opt/bootlocal.sh or via the "xvesa=" boot parameter.
		Usage: /usr/local/sbin/915resolution [-l] [Mode# X Y] [depth]
		Use the -l flag to get the list of modes and resolution from
		the video bios. And use without -l flag to modify one mode with
		new resolution and optionally new bits/pixel depth.
Change-log:	2008/12/25 First version
		2009/04/15 patched for eeepc
		2010/08/01 rewrote scripting part to recognise "xvesa=" boot
		parameter and recompiled with TCL 3.0
		2010/08/28 added patch to detect more chipsets found here:
