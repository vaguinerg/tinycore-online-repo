		If you want Truetype fonts, install some and
		libxft.tcz. That's it, Opera will
		now use them by default over bitmap fonts.

                Since Opera has a low-ram mode where e-mail,
                IRC, and RSS functionality is removed, and
                because it's primarily a browser, the icon
                launches this low-ram mode. Both are available
                in the menu.
