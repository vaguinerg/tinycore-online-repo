                From the web page:
                  pdnsd is a proxy DNS server with permanent caching
                  (the cache contents are written to hard disk on
                  exit) that is designed to cope with unreachable or
                  down DNS servers (for example in dial-in
                  networking)....  pdnsd can be used with applications
                  that do DNS lookups, e.g. on startup, and can't be
                  configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the
                  often minute-long hangs (or even crashes) that
                  result from stalled DNS queries.... pdnsd is
                  configurable via a file and supports run-time
                  configuration using the program pdnsd-ctl that comes
                  with pdnsd. This allows you to set the status flags
                  of servers that pdnsd knows (to influence which
                  servers pdnsd will query), and the addition,
                  deletion and invalidation of DNS records in pdnsd's
                  cache.
                The configuration file for pdnsd is
                  /usr/local/etc/pdnsd.conf
                which receives its initial value from
                  /usr/local/etc/pdnsd.conf.default
                That configuraton uses public servers from Google and
                OpenDNS.  Change those servers as needed and add the
                configuration file to you back-up set.  The sample
                configuration file from the pdnsd distribution is
                  /usr/local/etc/pdnsd.conf.sample
                The extension installs the script
                  /usr/local/etc/init.d/pdnsd
                to simplify usage of pdnsd.  Executing (e.g., in
                /opt/bootlocal.sh)
                  sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/pdnsd start
                will change /etc/resolv.conf to point to pdnsd and use
                the "-d" option to activate pdnsd as a daemon.  Add a
                "-g" and a "-d" option
                  sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/pdnsd start -g -d
                to execute pdnsd as a daemon and to record debug
                messages in the file
                  /var/cache/pdnsd/pdnsd.debug
                Use the "-g" option alone to execute in the foreground
                and see the debug messages on the console.  Executing
                  sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/pdnsd stop
                will terminate pdnsd and signal udhcpc to rewrite
                /etc/resolv.conf with the domain name servers that
                it obtains by querying its up-stream DHCP server.
                The DNS cache is saved to the disk file
                  /var/cache/pdnsd/pdnsd.cache
                when pdnsd terminates.  That file must be backed up if
                you wish to take advantage of pdnsd's persistent
                cache.  To test cache behavior, use
                  sudo pdnsd-ctl empty-cache
                to signal pdnsd to empty its cache. For example,
                  L=tinycorelinux.net ; sudo pdnsd-ctl empty-cache ; \
                    time nslookup $L ; time nslookup $L
                should show the second lookup being almost instantaneous.
                The default configuration sets
                  query_method = tcp_udp;
                which forces all up-stream DNS queries to be sent
                first using TCP and then using UDP if TCP fails.  That
                parameter can be changed to
                  query_method = tcp_only;
                or pdnsd can be invoked with the "-mto" option to
                force pdnsd to use TCP but to not fall back to UDP.
                Only using TCP is important for some encrypting
                proxies (e.g., the OpenSSH SOCKS proxy) that do not
                carry UDP traffic, in which case UDP DNS queries are
                not protected by the proxy and might reveal the sites
                that are being visited.
