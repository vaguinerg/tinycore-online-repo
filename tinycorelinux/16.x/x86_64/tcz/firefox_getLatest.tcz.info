Comments:		This script detects the latest available Firefox
			Browser, downloads the update and creates an
			extension.  The new or updated Firefox extension is
			then installed using tce-audit or scheduled for update
			during the next reboot.
			
			There are alternative options available,  for more
			help type at the command-line: 
			 firefox-getLatest.sh -h    (for more info)
				-m    (for manual version entry)
				-e    (for latest ESR release)
				-b    (for latest Beta release)
				-d    (don't regenerate .dep file)
				-g    (verify download with GnuPG keyring)

			Will create latest Firefox extension for:
			x86
			x86_64
			aarch64

			PulseAudio is required for sound (Mozilla disable ALSA
			support in these builds). Libavcodec is required for
			audio/video streaming.

			Requires a fonts extension to be installed, such as
			Xorg-fonts.tcz or dejavu-fonts-ttf.tcz.

			Note: The newly created extension is a replacement for
			the deprecated firefox-official extension. If found
			during an onboot check, this old extension will be
			scheduled for removal by tce-auit during the next
			reboot. The firefox-ESR extension will also be removed
			if it's found.
