Comments:       From http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/:
                  ntpclient is an NTP (RFC-1305) client for unix-alike
                  computers. Its functionality is a small subset of
                  xntpd, but IMHO performs better (or at least has the
                  potential to function better) within that limited
                  scope. Since it is much smaller than xntpd, it is
                  also more relevant for embedded computers.
                See http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/README and
                http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/HOWTO for more
                informtion.
                -----------------------------------------------------
                This extension was built from
                  http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/ntpclient_2007_365.tar.gz
                using CFLAGS='-march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe'.  The
                adjtimex command that is normally supplied with
                ntpclient is part of busybox.
                While this extension can be used as a daemon to adjust
                the system clock, Chrony is much easier to use.  This
                extension is useful if you want to independently verify
                how well Chrony is working or if you want to set the
                sytem clock immediately using NTP time.
                Examples:
		$ ntpclient -c 1 -h pool.ntp.org
		 day   second     elapsed    stall     skew  dispersion  freq
		40179 64730.007   52736.0     16.7   -8557.8  57006.8   3254000
                The fifth column (skew) gives the approximate offset in
                microseconds between the system clock and the specified
                NTP server.
                $ ntpclient -c 10 -i 60 -h pool.ntp.org
                This command will check the time every 60 seconds for
                10 minutes.
                $ sudo ntpclient -s -c 1 -h pool.ntp.org
                This command sets the system clock based on the time
                returned from the specified NTP server.  Running such
                a command as a cron job is a simple way to keep the
                system clock reasonably accurate, although time may
                be stepped backward.
