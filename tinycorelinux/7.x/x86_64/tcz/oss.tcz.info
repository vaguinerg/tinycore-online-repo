Comments:       This is a really awesome application that does many 
		different things I think the Core community will benefit 
		from :)
-
		Sound will be configured automatically when you load the 
		extension. However if you wish to see the messages, the 
		command is "sudo soundon".
-
		The optional GUI mixer (ossxmix.tcz) depends on GTK2; 
		the command-line mixer, ossmix, works in all systems.
-
		Some of the included apps:
		ossplay		Wave player
		ossrecord	Wave recorder
		ossmix		Console mixer
		osstest		A sound test
		ossinfo		Displays information about your sound
-
		Detected hardware and saved volume settings are in 
		/usr/lib/oss/etc, so you might want to add that to your 
		backup.
-
		Note: to compile apps that use OSS, no need to have OSS 
		loaded. The header file is in compiletc.
