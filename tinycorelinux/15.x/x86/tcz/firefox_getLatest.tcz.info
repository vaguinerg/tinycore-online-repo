Comments:		This script detects the latest available Firefox Browser, downloads the  
			update and creates an extension.  The new or updated Firefox extension
			is then installed using tce-audit or scheduled for update during the 
			next reboot.
			
			There are alternative options available,  for more help type at the 
			command-line: 
				firefox-getLatest.sh -h    (for more info)
				                     -m    (for manual version entry)
				                     -e    (for latest ESR release)
			                             -b    (for latest Beta release)
			                             -d    (don't regenerate .dep file)
			                             -g    (verify download with GnuPG keyring)

			Will create latest Firefox extension for:
			tc-14 x86
			tc-14 x86_64

			Note: The newly created extension is a replacement for the deprecated 
			firefox-official extension. If found during an onboot check, this old 
			extension will be scheduled for removal by tce-auit during the next
			reboot. The firefox-ESR extension will also be removed if it's found.
