Comments:       The base extension requires GTK2 and its dependencies.
		The extra extension requires the base extension.
		Optionally, add Perl to support screen savers with
		custom text.
		Neither extension includes OpenGL savers. This version
		was compiled and tested on TC 3.0.
		The base extension has 10 screen savers: bumps,
		fireworkx, rocks, strange, xmatrix, cloudlife,
		metaballs, speedmine, substrate, and xrayswarm.
		To start at boot, put the following to
		~/.X.d/xscreensaver:
		   xscreensaver -nosplash &
		To configure, use
		   xscreensaver-command -prefs
		In LXDE, a menu item is added under settings.
		For an additional 100 or so savers, get the 'extra'
		extension (xscreensaver-5.10-extra.tcz).
